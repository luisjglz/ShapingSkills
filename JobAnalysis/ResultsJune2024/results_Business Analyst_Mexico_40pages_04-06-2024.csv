Principal Business Analyst - Mexico,Principal Business Analyst - Mexico,Nubank,May,2024,"About Nubank

Nubank was founded in 2013 to free people from a bureaucratic, slow and inefficient financial system. Since then, through innovative technology and outstanding customer service, the company has been redefining people's relationships with money across Latin America. With operations in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, Nubank is today one of the largest digital banking platforms and technology-leading companies in the world.

Today, Nubank is a global company, with offices in São Paulo (Brazil), Mexico City (Mexico), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Bogotá (Colombia), Durham (United States), and Berlin (Germany). It was founded in 2013 in Sao Paulo, by Colombian David Vélez, and cofounded by Brazilian Cristina Junqueira and American Edward Wible. For more information, visit www.nu.com.mx.

Why are Business Analysts (BAs) important to Nubank?

As a company at the forefront of the financial revolution in Brazil, Nubank has experienced exponential growth since its inception. To keep your growth path healthy, numerous critical decisions constantly need to be made. Business Analysts are fundamental in the decision process because they must not only be able to deal with large amounts of information and data, but also always think of ways to improve our clients' experience.

It is BA's responsibility to structure the data, analyze it and use the results to test different solutions with the aim of improving Nubank's efficiency.

We are looking for a Principal or BA Manager who is independent and not afraid to take the initiative to identify and solve problems that are not necessarily obvious.

About The Position

Define backlog, prioritize activities, own the analytical agenda of a complex initiative and align with multiple groups and stakeholders to deliver a comprehensive solution to key business problems;
Guide team in research work, focusing on deciding which data makes the most sense to use in each situation. In case the data does not exist, will need to suggest different test options or how to extract the necessary information to answer outstanding questions;
Influence decisions based on high complexity analysis with a high degree of uncertainty and possible intersections with other areas (engineering, product, etc) with the objective of finding answers and solutions to business situations, comfortable with the process risk taking despite uncertainty;
