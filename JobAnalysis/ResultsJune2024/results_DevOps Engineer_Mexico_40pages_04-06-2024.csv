Stori is a fast-growing, venture-backed financial technology company, on a mission to democratize credit access for 400 million underbanked LatAm consumers. Stori currently operates in Mexico and has a global team with offices in Arlington Virginia, Mexico City, and Asia. We have quickly made our mark as one of the top digital banks in Mexico with more than two million applicants for our credit card product since launching.

Stori is one of the top-funded startups in the region with US$250 million raised to date. We are backed by top global venture capital funds, such as GGV Capital, GIC, Lightspeed Venture Partners, General Catalyst, Goodwater Capital, Mexico's Tresalia Capital, Vision Plus Capital, BAI Capital and Source Code Capital; who have successfully invested in startups such as Affirm, Airbnb, Alibaba, Stripe, and TikTok.

Stori has a standout founder team among fintechs, leveraging 100+ years of accumulated experience in consumer finance, banking and technology across Mastercard, Intel, Capital One, Morgan Stanley, GE Capital, and HSBC in the U.S., Mexico and Asia. The team has launched and managed many multi-million-customer credit card products globally, providing a wide breadth of experience and knowledge to our team.

We welcome diversity of background, experience and thinking. Storians are passionate about our mission and take pride in the products we build. Our culture thrives off of a flat structure and an inclusive environment where all of our employees can be their authentic selves, with boundless opportunities for professional growth.

The Role:

Stori is looking for an experienced DevOps engineer with a proven track record of optimizing infrastructure, enabling DevOps culture and promoting CICD best practices.

Responsibilities:

Defining enterprise CICD process standards and best practices
Building tools that to enable a DevOps culture where others can easily automate deployments, tests and monitoring
Optimizing infrastructure and scaling systems efficiently through tuning and architecture changes
Troubleshooting performance issues and ensuring system reliability

You are a good fit for the role if:

You enjoy solving problems from inception to implementation with everything in between.
You think in efficiencies and you break down ambiguity into tactical deliverable
You love the thought about CICD and knowing that you can build, test and deploy new features without any risk of an impact to production.
You want to build highly scalable products in a serverless environment on AWS with all infrastructure managed as code
You believe in building tools that to enable a DevOps culture where others can easily automate deployments, tests and monitoring
You are not (overly) intimidated by networking and have the will to automate deployments of VPCs, security groups, subnets, etc.
You have strong ideas for how products and features should work and you are willing to voice those opinions.
You have several years of experience with AWS and you would like to get into a mission driven startup backed by some of the most renowned investors and a proven leadership team.
You love working as a team and knowing that your teammates value you and will not let you down.

Required years of experience

4+ development in the AWS ecosystem
4+ developing CICD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS CodeBuild, Bamboo, etc.)
3+ Defining enterprise CICD process standards and best practices
2+ deploying infrastructure with AWS Cloud Formation Templates (CFTs)

Our Tech Stack:

We are serverless! Just about wherever possible, we are taking a serverless approach to development, highly leveraging containerized services and Lambdas on AWS. When we need a little more control over the environment or if we can't fit into the AWS constraints of a Lambda we leverage ECS and EKS for our containerized services. In the few places where we can't go serverless (e.g. databases), we select the product that best fits our needs. We use MySQL, Postgres and DynamoDB heavily for different use-cases but also Redis, graph DBs and a few others to meet specific use-case needs.

We use AWS extensively for nearly all of our services and we give all of our engineers full control to develop and test microservices within our development environment which exactly matches our production environment. Pipelines to deploy to production are managed by simply checking code into master in GitHub (although we can always make this more robust!).

International exposure & work experience
