Security Incident Responder Engineer,Security Incident Responder Engineer,Nubank,May,2024,"About Nubank

Tackling the complex banking system to empower people in one of the world's most bureaucratic markets seems like a crazy idea, right? But that's why, how, and where Nubank was born. We fight complexity through our transparent and straightforward products and experiences: a no-fee credit card, a rewards program, a lending platform, and a digital savings account. In a nutshell, we are the most innovative tech company in Latin America, and we are obsessed with building financial services and products that make our customers love us fanatically. With over 40 million customers and $1.2 billion raised in investment rounds, we are the fastest growing digital bank in the world, with offices in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Germany, EUA and Argentina. And it's still only Day One for us!

Infosec & Security Operation Center (SOC)

The Nubank Security Operation team proactively hunts for security threats that may affect Customers or Nubankers, acts fast on security incidents to investigate those threats, and applies mechanisms to mitigate them. Also, Security Operation has a strong engineering power to decrease the time to act on threats through automation and dedicated micro-services.

You can find more about Nubank Infosec here: https://blog.nubank.com.br/infosec-nubank-protecao-dados/

What is a typical day for a Senior Security Incident Responder?

The Nu Incident Response team analyzes information, discusses observations and activities, and shares reports and communications across the company. The amount of time spent on any one of these activities depends on one key question: Is this a time of calm or crisis? That’s why it’s essential to have an extraordinary person who combines intellectual curiosity with a tireless passion for never giving up, especially during times of crisis.

Security Operations (SecOps) is a collaboration between security and IT operations teams, where security and operations staff assume joint ownership and responsibility for security concerns. It is a set of SOC processes, practices, and tools that can help Nubank meet security goals more efficiently. As a Senior Security Incident Responder, you will identify several types of security incidents by understanding how attacks work, and how to effectively respond before they get out of hand.
