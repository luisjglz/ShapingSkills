Advanced understanding of iptables
Analysis of traffic for attack anomaly detection and creation of mitigation rules

Business Information Security Analyst,Business Information Security Analyst,HP,May,2024,"The BISA is responsible for supporting an IT wide information security management program along with Cybersecurity team, to ensure that information assets are adequately protected. This position is responsible for identifying, evaluating and reporting on information security risks in a manner that meets compliance and regulatory requirements, and aligns with and supports the risk posture of the enterprise. The position requires an expert with sound knowledge of information security technologies and a working knowledge of business management. The BISA will proactively work with IT towers/units to implement practices that meet defined policies and standards for information security. He or she will also oversee a variety of IT-related risk management activities. The BISE serves as the process owner of all assurance activities related to the availability, integrity and confidentiality of customer, business partner, employee and business information in compliance with the organization's information security policies. The BISA must be highly knowledgeable about the business environment and ensure that information systems are maintained in a fully functional, secure mode.
