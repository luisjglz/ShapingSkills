Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S.:

When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.",False,1686331222,2023-06-09T17:20:22.000Z,Ciudad de México,CDMX,MX,19.432608,-99.13321,,https://www.google.com/search?gl=us&hl=en&rciv=jb&q=computer+network+support+specialistsin+mexico&start=0&ibp=htl;jobs#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=computer+network+support+specialistsin+mexico&htidocid=jcTkYKZXrD-6nNv8AAAAAA%3D%3D,,,"{'no_experience_required': False, 'required_experience_in_months': None, 'experience_mentioned': True, 'experience_preferred': False}",,"{'postgraduate_degree': False, 'professional_certification': False, 'high_school': False, 'associates_degree': False, 'bachelors_degree': False, 'degree_mentioned': True, 'degree_preferred': True, 'professional_certification_mentioned': True}",False,,,,,{},Support engineer,en,15115200,4,3342,Communications Equipment Manufacturing,

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the “network,” which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand.

Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity.

In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud. ThousandEyes is also a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Full-Stack Observability (“FSO”) business.

About The Role

We're all familiar with the technology, but have you ever wondered how the Internet actually works? At ThousandEyes, we spend every day working to help customers understand the gotchas of Internet-based service delivery: how to identify problems, how to resolve, and how to avoid them in the future. Our Customer Engineering team is tasked with empowering our customers with ThousandEyes to ease their performance monitoring pains.

If you enjoy variety in job responsibilities, this is the job for you. A day may involve helping a customer identify network loss in an undersea cable, diagnose the cause of a route leak impacting significant portions of internet traffic, scripting an approach to monitoring a website's login flow, spinning up a lab environment to reproduce a strange set of behaviors seen in a customer's environment, saving a company hours of bridge time during a significant outage impacting their infrastructure by finding the smoking-gun in a network outage, or simply helping someone understand the way that our applications work. The job is highly variable and requires both the ability to make data-driven decisions, and draw conclusions based on incomplete information. We're looking for out-of-the-box thinkers who can complement and extend the already formidable talents of our Customer Enablement organization.

Who We Are

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the “network,” which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand.

Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity.

In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud. ThousandEyes is also a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Full-Stack Observability (“FSO”) business.
