• Demonstrable experience in administering Linux-based systems

• Self-taught and enthused to grow your skill set with new technologies as the industry continues to evolve
• Availability to travel for the occasional team meeting, conference or customer visit
• Experience working with customers in English
• Very desirable to have related Kubernetes knowledge

It's a bonus if you have experience with these:
• Experience working in SLA-bound operations
• OpenSource Community contributions (could be a blog)
• Good practice with working over screen-sharing/phone
• Galera / XtraDB Cluster / ProxySQL / Orchestrator
• Cloud Services such as AWS and RDS, Azure, GCP
• Percona Monitoring & Management (PMM) and other monitoring tools
