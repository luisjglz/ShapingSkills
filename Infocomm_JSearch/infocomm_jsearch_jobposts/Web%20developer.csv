About You
As a Senior Web Engineer, you should have a comprehensive understanding of modern web development, with an emphasis on PHP and modern JavaScript in a WordPress context.

A comprehensive understanding of the components and technologies related to WordPress is crucial to this role . While previous experience with WordPress (and Gutenberg) is not essential, it is highly recommended, and you will be expected to rapidly gain this in order to work effectively on project teams. This includes WordPress internals, including the bootstrap process, global state, and the majority of WordPress components. To enable you to architect complex WordPress projects, you should also have knowledge of the larger WordPress ecosystem, including commonly used third-party libraries

The responsibilities and expectations of a Senior Web Engineer are not necessarily tied to a specific project. While you will need to apply your skills on each project you are assigned to, you are also expected to set a similar example when interacting with the whole engineering team for meta-level tasks. This could be cross-project code review, helping other engineers debug problems, coaching, or offering advice and architectural guidance to other projects.

As a Senior Engineer, you should lead by example when working on projects, meeting with clients, giving critical feedback primarily via code review to peers and respecting other engineering decisions. Your broad experience in WordPress development may mean you have strong preferences for technical decisions. It’s both your responsibility to voice concerns about technical decisions being made, but also have the distance and maturity to accept decisions made by the team and/or project technical lead, and commit yourself to build solutions in the agreed-upon way. As Human Made develops large-scale WordPress sites, WordPress experience is desirable but not essential .

You should be familiar with the tools required for engineering projects. This includes a good understanding of Git, conflict resolution, local development environments, PHP configuration, following coding standards and general computer maintenance and security. You should be willing to adapt to the established processes in Human Made.

About Us

Human Made helps organizations drive customer engagement, reinforce brand value and improve operations with digital solutions powered by Altis, our WordPress digital experience platform.

Over the past 10+ years, we’ve helped brands such as Snopes, Siemens and USA Today build and deliver their digital strategies, transforming the way people interact with some of the most visited websites in the world. We have deep expertise and investment in using WordPress as a tool to create large-scale platforms, websites, and applications that drive transformational business value.

Our decade of experience in agile delivery and passion for open source solutions supports clients in their journey to embrace the edge of innovation. Human Made is a fully distributed company, with employees based remotely around the world.

Human Made* is a remote company: this means you will need to work both independently and as part of a remote team. You will have the opportunity to meet the rest of the company at our annual company meetup, and with members of the rest of your team at least once a year. We care about good communication and you should be able to prioritise your work and meet deadlines, discussing any problems with the team along the way. You can learn more about Human Made and what you can expect working here in our public company handbook .

Why Work at Human Made

We provide several tools and benefits (from remote work allowance to private healthcare and retirement savings) to ensure everyone feels appreciated and fairly acknowledged for the work they do. We lead our teams with utmost empathy and flexibility, allowing everyone to manage themselves with autonomy and all the support we can provide for them to be successful, as we understand the challenges of remote work.
