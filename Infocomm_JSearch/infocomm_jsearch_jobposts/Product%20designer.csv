Our mission is to provide authentic belonging experiences, empowering residents to become homeowners and homeowners to be financially free.

Belong is changing what it means to rent a home by putting people first. It’s where hospitality meets consumer real estate—and it’s about to redefine an entire industry. We’re backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), GGV Capital, Battery Ventures, and Fifth Wall just to name some of our all-star investors.

The Opportunity:

What once was difficult and stressful for homeowners and residents should now feel easy and seamless with Belong, perhaps even fun. In order to provide these magical customer experiences, we’re building a suite of internal software and automation to power and augment our operations teams. These tools enable each member of our team to manage more and more homes as we grow; this type of scalability allows us to become transformative in an industry resistant to change.

Our small, experienced design team is at the forefront of this transformation. As an early member of this team, you’ll own and co-create the design systems that our various teams use every day to run the business. We’re looking for someone who is passionate about the 'consumerization' of the internal tools, bringing the same level of design love, rigor, and customer-centricity that we have on our customer-facing website and apps.

Our co-founders have over a decade of experience in both construction and SaaS technology, as well as a resume that includes Stanford, Harvard, Wharton, Cornell, Microsoft, and multiple successful startup exits, including a $1.2 billion acquisition.

BuildOps has raised multiple rounds of funding from some of the largest and most reputable Venture Capital firms, including Founders Fund, Fika Ventures, Siemens Next47, and Greenspring Associates.

Forbes Magazine

“BuildOps is unique because it addresses the problem of efficiency in construction for an often-overlooked audience. Rather than focusing on large projects, or catering to owners, they look to the needs of technician-heavy subcontracting firms working in the commercial space.”

TechCrunch

“The new financing will be used to support the company’s continued growth. BuildOps sells software that integrates scheduling, dispatching, inventory management, contracts, workflow and accounting into a single software package for commercial real estate contractors with staff ranging from a few dozen to several hundred employees.”

With BuildOps, “you have one solution that does it all and talks seamlessly to every single part of their business from parts to ordering to inventory and more.”

Sora is the virtual private middle and high school turning today’s students into tomorrow’s change-makers. We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.

Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they’ve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.

In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don’t spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don’t read many traditional textbooks — instead, they’re building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We’ve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can’t wait for you to join us!

The Role

Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are engaging, intuitive, and impactful.

We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the later rest of the world.

Location and Salary

This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We’re excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don’t have experience in all the following areas.

We offer a competitive salary and perks based on the in country localized market.

What you'll do:

Sora is the virtual private middle and high school turning today’s students into tomorrow’s change-makers. We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.

Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they’ve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.

In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don’t spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don’t read many traditional textbooks — instead, they’re building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We’ve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can’t wait for you to join us!

The Role

Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are engaging, intuitive, and impactful.

We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the later rest of the world.

Location and Salary

This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We’re excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don’t have experience in all the following areas.

We offer a competitive salary and perks based on the in country localized market.

Sora is the virtual private middle and high school turning today’s students into tomorrow’s change-makers. We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.

Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they’ve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.

In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don’t spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don’t read many traditional textbooks — instead, they’re building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We’ve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can’t wait for you to join us!

The Role

You’ll also influence visual language, branding, marketing, and the end-to-end student, parent, and teacher experience at Sora beyond just digital touch-points.

Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are delightful and compelling.

We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the rest of the world.

Location and Salary

This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We’re excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don’t have experience in all the following areas.

We offer a competitive salary and perks based on the in country localized market.

As a Senior Product Designer at Zipline you will do just that – solving complex and interesting problems that help retail workers keep their day on track.

At Zipline, our mission is to bring retail operations out of the dark ages and give companies effective tools that their employees love to use. You will help improve the way that this 4.4 trillion dollar industry communicates with its store employees and save them from sad, slow, inefficient systems (think fax machines, voicemails, and the postal service). People deserve better! We need your help to make this happen.

We are a well-funded market leader and have great customers, but there is so much more to do and improve. We are looking for a Senior Product Designer to collaborate daily with product and engineering to drive concepts from idea to design to launch – balancing strategic direction with tactical execution to create high quality solutions our customers will love. You will dive deep into parts of the Zipline product, solving critical user needs and shipping solutions to challenging problems.

The user experience matters to us and our customers (Gap Inc, Allbirds, Lululemon, LEGO, and many more), and we want you to be part of shaping that!

Responsibilities
• Collaborate with Product and Engineering on setting long-term goals and direction, balanced with the incremental steps it will take to get there.
• Drive user research to better understand customer needs and gather feedback on concepts and solutions.
• Design flows, sketches, prototypes, UI, visual design, and more that solves customer needs and problems.
• Solicit feedback from your teammates and colleagues on the effectiveness of your ideas and design solutions.
• Facilitate design discussions, drive alignment on solutions, iterate on use cases and constraints, and ensure a high-quality UI and experience for our users.
• Execute quickly and efficiently, iterating and improving our product over time.
• Contribute to improving team processes and operations as part of a remote organization – demonstrating good communication and collaboration through leading by example.
• Promote a collaborative and inclusive environment for the team.

Must-haves
• 5+ years experience designing UX/UI solutions for desktop and mobile.
• Outstanding portfolio showcasing a foundation in information architecture, UI & interaction design, visual design, and working with design systems.
• Experience driving user interviews and concept testing with customers.
• Experience partnering with Product and Engineering to develop the rationale, options, and execution plans for your features.

More about you
• Retail experience is an asset, but not required
• Proficient in tools such as Figma, Slack, Google Docs, etc
• Ability to act with empathy and intentionality towards customers and colleagues.
• Ability to listen, understand, share, and collaborate with your teammates.
• Self-motivated, curious, and dependable.

Employee Benefits
• Stock Options
• Paid Flexible Time Off (including time off to care for family members, as well as Sick Time)
• Paid Parental Leave Benefit
• Group Health Insurance (Medical, Vision, and Dental) with a variety of PPO & HMO plans and a flexible spending account
• 401(k) Retirement Plan
• 100% Paid Life and Long-Term Disability Insurance

The “Extras”
• Remote Work: Join a flexible, effective remote team and work where you’re comfortable- literally anywhere! We’ve had Zipliners join us from vans, RVs, sailboats, and AirBnBs around the globe.
• Computer accessories and office setup: There’s a science to being effective at home and we help you get there with the right equipment and accessories that you need.
• Company off-sites: Most years we come together (IRL!). Past retreats were held in Santa Cruz, New York, Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, and Costa Rica.
• Education stipends: We believe in perpetual learning! If there’s a class that you want to take or a book that will help you expand your horizons, we’ll support it, as long as it fits within our team budgets.
• Coffee Stipend: To encourage breaks and a change of scenery, we provide a small stipend each month to get you out of the house and relax at your favourite coffee spot.

A note on our Flexible Time Off Policy – We don’t have a set number of “Days Off” at Zipline, and instead Zipliners request time off when and as they need it, under a Flexible Time Off Policy. Each request is then reviewed by your manager and a decision is made with all of the appropriate business considerations accounted for. Typically, we see Zipliners using 15-25 days per year, and it’s important to note that time off is not unlimited.

We value diversity of all kinds and are committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other. We are an equal-opportunity employer and welcome people of all different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives.

Got More Time, here’s more about Zipline!

How do we work?Remotely. We have been 100% remote since the company was founded. We come together as a company every week for our Wednesdays Socials, where the topic can be a classic “Standup” format, a micro learning around burnout and mental health, followed by discussion, or a silly trivia…and anything in between! Some Fridays, we come together to learn from each other. One week it might be about opossum rescue. Another week it might be an update on our product roadmap or the results of our customer satisfaction survey. We are all expert Zoom navigators, and love the freedom of working from anywhere, using technology to connect.

With Zipline, retail employees feel more connected, understand the role they play in the brand’s mission, and can feel good about the work they’re doing. This is important to us because retail is one of America’s most populous workforces but also one of the most underserved. Through Zipline, we can touch on one in four American workers whose jobs and needs are often underrepresented.

We have made incredible progress but changing the industry is hard. We are well funded by leading venture capital firms like Emergence Capital and ready to scale. We need your help to improve the way that this 4.4 trillion dollar industry communicates with its store employees. Cumbersome, slow, and inefficient systems should not be the status quo. Help us retool retail, and Keep Today on Track

Please let know you found this position on DesignX Job Board as a way to support us so we can keep fostering this community.

Contract: 12 Months with the possibility to extend, 37.5 hours per week (Self employed contract, you will be responsible to pay your own taxes)

Salary: $8 USD per hour

About Twinkl

Twinkl’s mission is to “help those who teach”, and from our humble beginnings in the UK we have since grown to become one of the largest digital educational publishers in the world. For over a decade now we have been providing educators across the world with high quality, trusted teaching resources for their classrooms, homes and learning centres.

This role

As a Graphic Designer at Twinkl, you’ll join a small production team made up of Teacher Content Writers, Teacher Content Editors, Illustrators and Graphic Designers to produce a wide variety of beautiful learning materials that will be downloaded, printed, and utilised for learning in education settings around the world. Upon joining, you’ll undergo 3 weeks of foundation training learning about our brand guidelines, design templates, software and working methods, giving you the tools needed to be a fantastic, efficient and effective designer of educational materials.

Once training is completed, you’ll utilise programs such as InDesign, PowerPoint and Word to work through a steady stream of editorial and layout design work, collaborating with the qualified teachers who write and check the content for our resources before they’re uploaded to our website. Within Country/Product teams we create different types of resources covering all areas of the curriculum and across a wide age range every week. The resource types and age range you will be working on will depend on the team you join. As such, you should be passionate about education and excited to contribute to a market-leading business that helps teachers spend more time with children and less time doing the admin that surrounds it.

A little about the culture within design

This position is a 12-month contract for 37.5 hours per week of work. As a self-employed position, it comes with lots of flexibility in how you manage your schedule, but unlike many other freelance roles you’ll be welcomed into and feel very much a part of a focused team that meets regularly via video call, collaborates together and works closely as its own production unit. This is a great environment for anyone looking for a close knit, communicative and friendly work environment, but less well suited to those who would prefer the total flexibility and independence that shorter term, project based freelance positions offer.

As a designer at Twinkl, you’ll also benefit from being part of a global community of 200+ Graphic Designers across different levels of experience, backgrounds and specialisms. The team regularly shares and celebrates the excellent work that they produce with each other, as well as running forums to share knowledge, tips and tricks to keep your design practice as sharp as possible.

Applying

If you are interested in becoming part of the amazing Twinkl design team, send us your CV and portfolio of your best editorial and layout design work (think magazines, booklets, posters and anything that involves heavy text) and we may be in contact to discuss adding you to our Graphic design pool. When suitable roles become available, we’ll get in touch regarding the next steps of the recruitment process. Being in the pool does not prevent you from applying for other Twinkl roles, so please keep a lookout on our careers page too.

How you’ll spend your day:
• Your morning may start with a short video call with the rest of your production team. This meeting gives everyone a chance to update on what you’re working on, highlight any blockers and review priorities. It’s also a chance to have a chat with your colleagues and set you up for the day ahead!
• Day to day, you’ll use InDesign, PowerPoint and Word to work on creating the highest priority resources in your team's production backlog. This work lives in a project management system called “Jira”, which you’ll receive full training on when you join.
• You may also have a regular catch up with your line manager to check in on how you’re feeling and the work you’re involved in. Or a CPD (continuous professional development) session organised by the training team. There’s always lots to get involved in if you’re interested in growth within the business.

To succeed in the role, you will:
• Have excellent English language skills.
• Have strong experience in InDesign.
• Have experience of following brand guidelines.
• Be able to take on feedback and use this to further develop your designs.
• Have an eye for detail, creativity and imagination.
• Be proficient at managing workload and meeting targets and deadlines.
• Care about education and helping teachers and learners across the globe

In this role, you will learn:
• How to be an in-house designer within a professional workplace.
• Learn and understand the resource lifecycle from our teachers writing the content to our users downloading the content to teach.
• Learn the importance of the end user, accessibility and functionality.
• To work in an Agile production team environment.
• Work with other Twinklees across the business through live briefs and workshops to improve your design practice.
• Opportunities to learn more about different areas within Twinkl via shadowing.

You’ll work with:
• An international team of designers, illustrators & teachers to create our world renowned teaching materials.
• A team leader and a team of 200+ designers from other products who you can share ideas and solutions with.
• A variety of people from other departments in the business.

We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.
Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they've always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.
In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don't spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don't read many traditional textbooks — instead, they're building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We've embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can't wait for you to join us!
The Role Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are engaging, intuitive, and impactful.
We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the later rest of the world.
