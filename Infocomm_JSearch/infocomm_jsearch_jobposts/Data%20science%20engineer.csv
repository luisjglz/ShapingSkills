We are an early-stage, venture-backed fintech that focuses on bringing affordable credit and financial services to small business owners across LatAm - starting with Mexico.

Grupago is able to serve micro-SMBs as a result of three key innovations – AI-driven underwriting, group collateral, and community distribution:
• AI-driven underwriting: Grupago harnesses the power of AI including non-traditional data sources to underwrite small loans. Over time, they systematically expand credit limits as customers demonstrate successful repayment histories.
• Group collateral: Borrowers join together as part of lending groups and co-sign for each other’s loans. When a payment is missed, other members are responsible for repayment. This approach allows Grupago to profitably collateralize an otherwise uncollateralized customer segment, as well as build much more robust underwriting data than individual loans.
• Community distribution: Grupago acquires community leaders online, who then build lending groups in their local communities. This allows the company to reach rural and otherwise hard to reach customers via its unique and cost effective online-to-offline acquisition approach.

Grupago is the first fintech company in the world to bring together these components into a unique, fully digitalized offering. It is active in Mexico and seeks to scale across Latin America over time. Its first focus is on a group loan product focused on women entrepreneurs.

We are backed by top venture investors across the US and Mexico, and our co-founding team has spent their careers working in fintech and entrepreneurship.

This role will include a competitive salary, bonus, and equity compensation.

Responsibilities

We are looking for a hard-working and highly entrepreneurial data scientist / machine learning engineer to join our team and work with the co-founders to build and refine our initial machine learning model for automated credit issuance.

You will have primary ownership over managing our machine learning model to allow us to instantly approve new group loans at low loss rates.

You will have immense responsibilities and ownership across a small and highly capable team.

Your main responsibilities are to:
• Build our automated credit model
• Continuously improve and refine models focused on loss rates and profitability
• Work closely with the CEO and MX country manager to apply modeling and data science to other aspects of our business – especially acquisition and unit profitability

Experience

We are looking for a data scientist experienced in rapidly building machine learning models – ideally within credit underwriting.

Our ideal candidate has:
• A stellar track record across least 5 years of data science experience
• Ideally have work experience within micro-business credit or consumer households at the bottom of the pyramid
• Fluent in business English & Spanish
• Previous work experience at a startup or other fast moving, highly entrepreneurial work environment

At Factored, we believe that passionate, smart people expect honesty and transparency, as well as the freedom to do the best work of their lives while learning and growing as much as possible. Great people enjoy working with other passionate, smart people, so we believe in hiring right, and are very selective about who joins our team. Once we hire you, we will invest in you and support your career and professional growth in many meaningful ways. We hire people who are supremely intelligent and talented, but we recognize that intelligence is not enough. Perhaps more importantly, we look for those who are also passionate about our mission and are honest, diligent, collaborative, kind to others, and fun to be around. Life is too short to work with people who don't inspire you.

We are a transparent workplace, where EVERYBODY has a voice in building OUR company, and where learning and growth is available to everyone based on their merits, not just on stamps on their resume. As impressive as some of the stamps on our resumes are, we recognize that human talent and passion exist everywhere, and come from many backgrounds, so stamps matter much less than results. All of us are dedicated doers and are highly energetic, focusing vehemently on execution because we know that the best learning happens by doing. We recognize that we are creating OUR COMPANY TOGETHER, which is not only a high-performing fast-growing business, but is changing the way the world perceives the quality of technical talent in Latin America. We are fueled by the great positive impact we are making in the places where we do business, and are committed to accelerating careers and investing in hundreds (and hopefully thousands) of highly talented data science engineers and data analysts.

In short, our business is about people, so we hire the best people and invest as much as possible in making them fall in love with their work, their learning, and their mission. When not nerding out on data science, we love to make music together, play sports, play games, dance salsa, cook delicious food, brew the best coffee, throw the best parties, and generally have a great time with each other.

We are an early-stage, venture-backed fintech that focuses on bringing affordable credit and financial services to small business owners across LatAm - starting with Mexico.

Grupago is able to serve micro-SMBs as a result of three key innovations – AI-driven underwriting, group collateral, and community distribution:
• AI-driven underwriting: Grupago harnesses the power of AI including non-traditional data sources to underwrite small loans. Over time, they systematically expand credit limits as customers demonstrate successful repayment histories.
• Group collateral: Borrowers join together as part of lending groups and co-sign for each other’s loans. When a payment is missed, other members are responsible for repayment. This approach allows Grupago to profitably collateralize an otherwise uncollateralized customer segment, as well as build much more robust underwriting data than individual loans.
• Community distribution: Grupago acquires community leaders online, who then build lending groups in their local communities. This allows the company to reach rural and otherwise hard to reach customers via its unique and cost effective online-to-offline acquisition approach.

Grupago is the first fintech company in the world to bring together these components into a unique, fully digitalized offering. It is active in Mexico and seeks to scale across Latin America over time. Its first focus is on a group loan product focused on women entrepreneurs.

We are backed by top venture investors across the US and Mexico, and our co-founding team has spent their careers working in fintech and entrepreneurship.

This role will include a competitive salary, bonus, and equity compensation.

Responsibilities

We are looking for a hard-working and highly entrepreneurial data scientist / machine learning engineer to join our team and work with the co-founders to build and refine our initial machine learning model for automated credit issuance.

You will have primary ownership over managing our machine learning model to allow us to instantly approve new group loans at low loss rates.

You will have immense responsibilities and ownership across a small and highly capable team.

Your main responsibilities are to:
• Build our automated credit model
• Continuously improve and refine models focused on loss rates and profitability
• Work closely with the CEO and MX country manager to apply modeling and data science to other aspects of our business – especially acquisition and unit profitability

Experience

We are looking for a data scientist experienced in rapidly building machine learning models – ideally within credit underwriting.

Our ideal candidate has:
• A stellar track record across least 5 years of data science experience
• Ideally have work experience within micro-business credit or consumer households at the bottom of the pyramid
• Fluent in business English & Spanish
• Previous work experience at a startup or other fast moving, highly entrepreneurial work environment

Brilliant is making a world of great problem solvers. We focus on adults learning quantitative skills – especially in math, data, and CS/AI – and deliver a best-in-class interactive learning experience across web and apps. Our courses teach you what you need to know, while skipping the stuff you don’t – so expect more about solving equations, statistical analysis, logical deduction, neural networks, and generative AI, and less about abstract theorems and integrating complicated trig functions.

We serve hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers, and we’re hoping you might be the right person to contribute to accelerating our footprint to millions of customers (and changed lives). In addition to what’s below, you can see all open roles and learn more about our team culture on our careers page.

We have always prioritized building a healthy business as the backbone of achieving our mission. We are default alive (will be profitable before needing to raise), have never had layoffs, are growing new customers at an exciting pace (high double-digits year-over-year). Our investors are top-tier + mission aligned, and we’ve kept our valuations tethered to reality – we aren’t playing “catch up” like many others.

In our day-to-day, we value adventure, excellence, generosity, and candor. We are optimists in the face of uncertainty, we take pride in our work, we go the extra mile for each other, and we tell it like it is (the good and the bad). We’re all here to do the best work of our lives together, and have a lot of fun along the way.

We believe that real-time collaboration and human connection are necessary ingredients in building a high-velocity, creatively-oriented consumer product. We maintain core hours (10am - 3pm Pacific) where everyone is online, regardless of timezone. Over half of us are located near our hubs in SF and NYC, and folks outside of those cities travel to attend team offsites once-per-quarter.

The Role

In this high-autonomy position, you'll direct the development and maintenance of our data infrastructure and data developer experiences for the benefit of the Data and Engineering teams. You’ll collaborate closely with a team of 4 data scientists and 5 engineering managers across an engineering team of 40. Your work will be among the most highly leveraged in the company.

You’ll build and extend modern data infrastructure built around dbt (including dbt Cloud) and Snowflake, with supporting tools like Fivetran, Census, and Amplitude.

Responsibilities
- Design efficient and scalable data pipeline architecture for collecting data across a variety of sources, enabling different functions to leverage transformed data for analytics and operations.
- Improve existing data modeling and deployment practices, fostering best practices to make the team more efficient and improve data quality.
- Collaborate with engineers, product managers, and data scientists to understand data needs, overseeing end-to-end event instrumentation for new features, including naming conventions and properties.
- Drive data “operationalization” – ensuring that we’re sending the right data to the right tools and services, on time and under cost (such as by management of tools like Census).
- Ensure consistent pipeline performance when it comes to latency and error-handling.
- Optimize the entire data stack — from data storage to transformation to analytical tooling — from a performance, cost, and scalability standpoint.
- Lead us into a future of convenient data governance, by selecting ideal CDP and supporting tools.

Who are you?
- **Experienced**: You bring at least 5 years of software engineering experience, including at least 2 years of working directly with some part of the “modern” data stack (dbt core & cloud, Fivetran, Snowflake, or equivalents).
- **Empathy for both worlds:** You’ve worked closely enough with software engineering teams to understand their concerns and have also walked in the shoes of a data scientist.
- **Technically proficient**: You possess advanced SQL skills and solid Python skills, and you’ve directly built or managed live systems which involved reliance on third-party tools.
- **A builder**: You’re enthusiastic about establishing the foundations of a data team and their tools from scratch.

What might you tackle in the first 90 days?
- Audit our data infrastructure from top to bottom to proactively identify performance, scale, and complexity considerations.
- Audit our data stack (e.g. Snowflake, Fivetran, dbt, Census, Amplitude, Avo) to ensure conformity to best practices.
- Audit existing ELT process for business critical data models and recommend ways to improve data quality, integrity, and reliability.
- Review and extend data observability, monitoring, and alerting — with a deep empathy for how data issues could adversely affect the end user experience.
- Determine priority (and vendor/OSS selection) for data governance tooling.
- Determine priority and general implementation approach for supporting managed business metrics throughout dbt and related tools.",True,1709334086,2024-03-01T23:01:26.000Z,,Méx.,MX,19.496874,-99.72327,,https://www.google.com/search?gl=us&hl=en&rciv=jb&q=data+science+engineerin+mexico&start=20&ibp=htl;jobs#fpstate=tldetail&htivrt=jobs&htiq=data+science+engineerin+mexico&htidocid=HobFRG2cX8hqvGRZAAAAAA%3D%3D,,,"{'no_experience_required': False, 'required_experience_in_months': 60, 'experience_mentioned': True, 'experience_preferred': False}",,"{'postgraduate_degree': False, 'professional_certification': False, 'high_school': False, 'associates_degree': False, 'bachelors_degree': False, 'degree_mentioned': False, 'degree_preferred': False, 'professional_certification_mentioned': False}",False,,,,,{},Engineer,en,43911100,4,,,

Grupago is able to serve micro-SMBs as a result of three key innovations – AI-driven underwriting, group collateral, and community distribution: AI-driven underwriting: Grupago harnesses the power of AI including non-traditional data sources to underwrite small loans. Over time, they systematically expand credit limits as customers demonstrate successful repayment histories. Group collateral: Borrowers join together as part of lending groups and co-sign for each other's loans. When a payment is missed, other members are responsible for repayment. This approach allows Grupago to profitably collateralize an otherwise uncollateralized customer segment, as well as build much more robust underwriting data than individual loans. Community distribution: Grupago acquires community leaders online, who then build lending groups in their local communities. This allows the company to reach rural and otherwise hard to reach customers via its unique and cost effective online-to-offline acquisition approach. Grupago is the first fintech company in the world to bring together these components into a unique, fully digitalized offering. It is active in Mexico and seeks to scale across Latin America over time. Its first focus is on a group loan product focused on women entrepreneurs.
