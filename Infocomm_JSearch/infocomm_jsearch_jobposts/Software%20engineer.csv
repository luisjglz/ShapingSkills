Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Osmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

• *To be considered for this position, resumes must be sent in English**

We value well-tested, reusable designs and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. For more information about Very, go here.

Why work at Very?

The health, happiness, and long-term career growth of our team are a top priority. What does that mean in practice? We give stipends for internet and telephone. We offer up to 21 weeks of maternity leave, 12 weeks of paternity leave, and 12 weeks for adoption or surrogacy. We have a $1,000 office stipend that allows you to make your battle station somewhere you’re excited to work. Each employee gets a professional development stipend to use on conference registration, continuing education, professional memberships, etc... We're a remote-first company, so you can work where you want (in a hammock on the beach, anyone?). But a healthy company culture isn't just about perks. It's about creating an environment where our employees can lead fulfilling lives, both at work and at home. Working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Very, it’s a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected. If you’re looking around wondering why people aren’t in “crunch mode,” the answer’s pretty simple. The thing we work hardest at is hiring good people, so we want them to stick around and have a good balance between work and the rest of the important stuff in life.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
Job Description

This full stack role involves building backend services to take automated actions to protect our ecosystem, and building front end experiences to empower our risk management customer success teams to move fast and make important decisions. This is an opportunity to grow and influence the direction of a strategic new team. Our engineers work on small teams with people across engineering, product, and creative functions to build reliable, fast, responsive, and beautiful software. Square has a remote first organizational strategy, and you’ll work in a team which is remote based with opportunities to travel. We believe that nobody starts any role as an expert.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

This role is for the Invoices team. Square Invoices is the easiest way for merchants to close sales and collect payments remotely. Our customers rely on our products because they are well-designed, easy to use, and integrated with their business. We are a full-stack product oriented team, spanning across engineering, design, product, data science, and marketing. You'll implement management’s roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry-leading growth goals.

Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly, anywhere, at any time. At the same time, we are doing this in an efficient and scalable way, making smart choices about how to automate critical functions for our merchants.

As a mobile engineer on the Invoices team, you will work within Square’s Point of Sale codebase and have the ability to impact all of the apps in our ecosystem, including our Invoices app.

You Will:

• Build high availability and resilient systems which can accept and report payments no matter the network or device conditions.

Qualifications

You Have:

• Fluency in Spanish and English

• Strong communication skills and a demonstrated ability to work cross-functionally with other functions, such as designers, product managers, data scientists, marketing, and business development to deliver a great product
• Experience creating readable, pragmatic code
• An appreciation for the connection between the software you build and the experience it delivers to customers

To this end, we take great care to evaluate all employees and job applicants equally, based on merit, competence, and qualifications.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.
Job Description

Fraud Risk Engineering works to protect Square and our customers $25B+ in payments from fraud and payment disputes. We build systems to detect and respond to potential fraud threats, provide outstanding tools to agents for investigating fraud events, and give our customers seamless web and mobile experiences to manage and fight payment disputes.

You will report to the Senior Engineering Manager for Fraud Risk in North America.
• Risk Operations Tooling: The Risk Operations Tooling team builds internally facing solutions to help protect Square and our sellers from a wide array of risk vectors. This full stack role involves building backend services to take automated actions to protect our ecosystem, and building front end experiences to empower our risk management customer success teams to move fast and make important decisions. This is an opportunity to grow and influence the direction of a strategic new team. Our engineers work on small teams with people across engineering, product, and creative functions to build reliable, fast, responsive, and beautiful software. Square has a remote first organizational strategy, and you’ll work in a team which is remote based with opportunities to travel. We believe that nobody starts any role as an expert. We’re looking for motivated individuals with a desire to build remarkable solutions. You will report to the Senior Engineering Manager for Core Risk Engineering.

Today, mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young adults, and are tied to shortening lifespans. While there have been developments in new psychiatric medications since the first FDA approval in 1954, today there is a growing movement among clinicians, patients, and researchers who are recognizing the need to accelerate new science.

The Osmind treatment platform is the first and only solution that solves specific challenges faced by neuropsychiatric clinics, spanning general psychiatry and interventional psychiatry (transcranial magnetic stimulation, ketamine, SPRAVATO®, psychedelic medicine, electroconvulsive therapy). The core electronic health record (EHR) technology is precisely developed for interventional treatment workflows and designed to support a strong therapeutic alliance, including journaling tools and assistance with health plan reimbursement, which is a significant access hurdle for millions of patients.

Research from our platform is already helping to set new standards for mental health interventions. For example, in the largest published real-world analysis of ketamine infusion therapy for depression, we teamed up with Stanford University School of Medicine to share findings in the Journal of Affective Disorders (March 2022). We have multiple ongoing research studies leveraging our proprietary real-world data, including an even larger ketamine analysis leveraging machine learning to predict treatment outcomes.

Osmind is a San Francisco–based public benefit corporation led by scientists, technologists, and psychiatrists. We are backed by top investors including DFJ Growth, General Catalyst, Future Ventures, Tiger Global, and Y Combinator.

The Tech Lead is a member of a mission-driven cross-functional team that includes engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.

Our Tech Lead manages, mentors, and supports team members in their personal growth and professional development. Tech Leads at Luca are cultural ambassadors - they communicate exceptionally well, they are humble and win the respect of their teams by personal example rather than authority.

Who are you?

You know what empathy is and like autonomy. You are also self motivated and energetic Tech Lead who believes that this planet would be much better through better education.

You love a fast-paced environment, but you also know that “fast-paced” can be incredibly fun, zen and supportive... ah, and you are not arrogant and treat people the same way you would like to be treated.

You should be goal-oriented and keen to implement processes, automations and work with no-code tools. You can work without any supervision or mentorship, but you don't mind asking if needed (after you tried, or asked father Google).

Familiarity with common Front-end (Angular, React, HTML, CSS) and Back-end (PHP, Node, Python) frameworks enough to understand technical challenges, take decisions and make hands-on contributions if needed.

Programming, debugging experience, and excellent problem solving skills, along with knowledge of CS fundamentals, such as data structures, algorithms, database concepts, and OS.

Demonstrated ability to work effectively both within a small team and cross-group to drive identification and resolution of issues to ship under tight deadlines along with being able to drive features into the product.

Ability to plan and prioritize the team's tasks as a SCRUM master as part of Agile development process, and identify timelines, blockers and dependencies in advance.

Ability to alter decisions and timelines based on unforeseen changes in the team.

Must be highly motivated with a strong commitment towards software quality and strong customer focus.

Fluent in english, both written and verbal

Preferences

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field or equivalent experience.

Having experience with video platforms is a plus.

But the most important is, you are a freak like we are, you love what you do and you want to enjoy your work while building something important for the world.

Why join Luca?

Because we love what we do and we are always aiming to hire better people than us. At Luca you will have the rare chance to work in a vibrant and energizing start-up culture with flat hierarchies and with very clear core values: empathy, autonomy and fun.

❤️ People - Treat colleagues and clients as you would treat your family, always.

   Autonomy - You, your opinions, and actions are appreciated, but do it responsibly.

  ️ Fun - Have fun, go remote, party, in a way you collaborate to build the best educational platform of the world

We are a diverse decentralised team with offices in Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona and Mexico City (and counting!). We have no space for arrogance, empty corporate bs, lack of empathy or mistreatment. We treat people as we would treat our family, for real, and we also believe that people should have fun, flexibility and good perks, but knowing that hard working is very important to build something great (mental health friendly:).

Sounds like a plan? Apply to the job and let's make it happen.

At Luca you can also:

Work in one of the Fastest growing Edtech companies in the region

Be in the best place to be challenged and be part of a fun team at the same time.

Many more benefits are coming soon…
