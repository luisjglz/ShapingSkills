When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

At Palo Alto Networks® everything starts and ends with our mission:

Being the cybersecurity partner of choice, protecting our digital way of life.

Our vision is a world where each day is safer and more secure than the one before. We are a company built on the foundation of challenging and disrupting the way things are done, and we’re looking for innovators who are as committed to shaping the future of cybersecurity as we are.

Our Approach to Work

We lead with flexibility and choice in all of our people programs. We have disrupted the traditional view that all employees have the same needs and wants. We offer personalization and offer our employees the opportunity to choose what works best for them as often as possible - from your wellbeing support to your growth and development, and beyond!

At Palo Alto Networks, we believe in the power of collaboration and value in-person interactions. This is why our employees generally work from the office three days per week, leaving two days for choice and flexibility to work where you feel most effective.

While details may evolve, our goal is to create an environment where innovation thrives, with office-based teams coming together three days a week to collaborate and thrive, together!

Your Career

You’re a critical thinker in understanding the methods, techniques, and evaluation criteria for obtaining results. You’ll enjoy networking with key contacts outside your own area of expertise, with a strong capability of detailing difficult technical issues to both non-technical and technical professionals.

You will regularly participate in technical discussions with multi-functional teams, creating an environment of transparency that ultimately leads to better products, better working environments, and better cybersecurity. Your quick thinking and support to our clients provides the fast assistance they need to keep their environments secure – which means you’ll need to move quickly, thoughtfully, and provide technical assistance as needed (often, in high pressure situations).

• Assist with conducting Root Cause Analysis (RCA) on critical production outages to develop and implement future mitigation strategies
• Utilize production support expertise to influence and support new designs, architectures, standards, and methods to maintain stability and availability for large-scale distributed systems
• Proactively identify and implement automations for routine maintenance tasks, data gathering, and resolution of common issues
• Continuously seek to develop new skills and technical expertise, and proactively share knowledge with others

Basic Qualifications:
• Bachelors or equivalent certification
• At least 2 years of experience managing and troubleshooting incident bridge calls
• At least 2 years of experience with Python scripting

• Of course, this is just a sample of the kinds of work this role will require! You should assume that your role will encompass other tasks, too, and that your job duties and responsibilities may change from time to time at Etsy Inc’s discretion, or otherwise applicable with local law.

Qualities that will help you thrive in this role are:
• Having a solid understanding of your chosen languages and frameworks while exhibiting curiosity and the ability to ramp up on new technologies quickly when called for. Experience with Ruby on Rails, Postrgres, ElasticSearch, Redis, Docker are all huge plusses.
• Experience with unit testing (whether TDD, BDD, or spike it first and test it later) and a desire to push everyone to do better.
• An ability and desire to work in multiple parts of the stack - “Fullstack” can include server-side, web browser, mobile app and more.
• Solving problems and creating features that strike the right balance between delivering results quickly and being dependable at scale.
• You default to taking ownership of your work - you make it happen.
