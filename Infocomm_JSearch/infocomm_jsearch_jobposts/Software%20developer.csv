Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

We value well-tested, reusable designs and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. For more information about Very, go here.

Why work at Very?

The health, happiness, and long-term career growth of our team are a top priority. What does that mean in practice? We give stipends for internet and telephone. We offer up to 21 weeks of maternity leave, 12 weeks of paternity leave, and 12 weeks for adoption or surrogacy. We have a $1,000 office stipend that allows you to make your battle station somewhere you’re excited to work. Each employee gets a professional development stipend to use on conference registration, continuing education, professional memberships, etc... We're a remote-first company, so you can work where you want (in a hammock on the beach, anyone?). But a healthy company culture isn't just about perks. It's about creating an environment where our employees can lead fulfilling lives, both at work and at home. Working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Very, it’s a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected. If you’re looking around wondering why people aren’t in “crunch mode,” the answer’s pretty simple. The thing we work hardest at is hiring good people, so we want them to stick around and have a good balance between work and the rest of the important stuff in life.

Tech Lead Remote

We are looking to meet our new Tech Lead, to contribute to our mission of democratizing K12 Education in Latam.

As the Tech Lead for Luca, you will be working as a core member of Luca´s team and interacting directly with the other departments.

You will... have a very diverse role and will be working building great experiences for our students, using best engineering practices, and managing a global team as we scale our business. You’ll be working as a core member of Luca´s team.

The Tech Lead is a member of a mission-driven cross-functional team that includes engineers, product managers, designers, and analysts.

Our Tech Lead manages, mentors, and supports team members in their personal growth and professional development. Tech Leads at Luca are cultural ambassadors - they communicate exceptionally well, they are humble and win the respect of their teams by personal example rather than authority.

Who are you?

You know what empathy is and like autonomy. You are also self motivated and energetic Tech Lead who believes that this planet would be much better through better education.

You love a fast-paced environment, but you also know that “fast-paced” can be incredibly fun, zen and supportive... ah, and you are not arrogant and treat people the same way you would like to be treated.

You should be goal-oriented and keen to implement processes, automations and work with no-code tools. You can work without any supervision or mentorship, but you don't mind asking if needed (after you tried, or asked father Google).

Provides daily management and leadership for a team.

Oversees overall project management and quality control of the team’s efforts.

Provides the team a roadmap for implementing software engineering practices for higher code quality.

Be hands-on and engage in coding to help the team to develop the solution and solve all surfacing problems at hand

Responsible for the technical design of the solution.

Designs the overall technical architecture of the solution with the help of the team.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.

Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.

There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Job Description

This role is for the Invoices team. Square Invoices is the easiest way for merchants to close sales and collect payments remotely. Our customers rely on our products because they are well-designed, easy to use, and integrated with their business. We are a full-stack product oriented team, spanning across engineering, design, product, data science, and marketing. You'll implement management’s roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry-leading growth goals.

Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly, anywhere, at any time. At the same time, we are doing this in an efficient and scalable way, making smart choices about how to automate critical functions for our merchants.

As a mobile engineer on the Invoices team, you will work within Square’s Point of Sale codebase and have the ability to impact all of the apps in our ecosystem, including our Invoices app.
