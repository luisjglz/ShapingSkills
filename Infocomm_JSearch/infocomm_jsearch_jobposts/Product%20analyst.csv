Founded in 2014, Wonolo's mission is to help people find consistent work. Through our two-sided tech marketplace, we connect hundreds of businesses in need of front-line workers with 1 million underemployed workers in local markets across the United States, within minutes. Wonolo recently raised $140M in growth funding which will continue to help us empower the in-demand workforce by democratizing access to flexible work, opportunities to learn new skills, a living wage, and comprehensive portable benefits and perks.

We are looking for a Junior Product Analyst to work with Wonolo’s Product Analytics and Operations teams. This analytics position will be a hybrid of both product analytics and low-code product development. The Junior Product Analyst will work across the technology team with a focus on Product Operations and low-code solutions.

In this role, you will look to understand the users' needs and uncover opportunities for improvement through data analysis. You’ll also have the opportunity to participate in low-code solution development to ensure our product automations and processes are scalable. We are looking for a hacker mindset and someone who is always seeking to enhance the way things work. If you are a highly motivated and innovative individual with a passion for data analytics and a strong interest in low-code product solutions, this is the role for you!

You will be employed by a third-party legal entity authorized to do business in the location in which you reside and you will provide contractual services to Wonolo’s Product team. This is a great opportunity to work on large-scale products and lead key architectural initiatives.

You will be a big driver in delivering a world-class customer experience. Our current analytics stack consists of Looker, Snowflake, dbt, and FullStory. For product operations, our stack mainly consists of Zapier, Prismatic, Segment and Airtable/Google Sheets, and many others (depending on the challenge). We encourage you to apply even if these are novel to you - if you have a solid understanding of data and SQL, most of this stack can be learned.

We welcome qualified candidates located anywhere in LatAm #LI-Remote.

What you'll do:
• Develop insights that drive new product work for the Demand team and its products. This is both at a high, strategic level as well as tactical, day-to-day decisions.

• Develop product health metrics and KPIs.
• Identify potential areas for improvement and automation across the organization.
• Gain a deeper understanding of the identified opportunities and their underlying causes.
• Collaborate with stakeholders and provide training to ensure effective adoption of the implemented solutions.
• Work closely with the Engineering team to assess and select the most suitable tools and approaches for building and executing the automation plan.
• Provide support when implemented solutions have issues, and continuously iterate and improve them based on feedback and evolving needs.
• Collaborate cross-functionally both within the Technology team (Product, Design, User Research, Engineering) and with the broader business teams (Supply Management, Growth Marketing, Business Analytics, and more)

Who you are:
• You have at least 1+ years of experience working in data analytics
• Proficiency in SQL writing.
• Familiarity with Python and/or Javascript.
• You are able to take an open-ended, ambiguous high-level question and break it down into specific analyses and provide answers.
• You have an understanding of common analytical frameworks and analysis types, e.g. A/B test analyses, retention analysis, KPI creation.
• You think critically about analyses, goals, and strategy; ask good questions and pressure-tests assumptions. You have a healthy suspicion of data quality.
• Keen interest in staying up-to-date with industry trends, tools, and best practices related to Low/No code development and automation.
• You are a strong communicator. You are able to speak in deep technical detail to the other analysts or data eng, but also able to abstract out and deliver key findings to stakeholders with less technical acumen.
• You exemplify a humble competence that inspires others and raises our collective bar (#OneTeamOneDream).

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
