Sora is the virtual private middle and high school turning today’s students into tomorrow’s change-makers. We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.

Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they’ve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.

In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don’t spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don’t read many traditional textbooks — instead, they’re building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We’ve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can’t wait for you to join us!

The Role

We are looking for a Senior User Interface Designer to drive the next stage of Sora's digital platform design.

The platform is critical in delivering an innovative educational experience to students as well as serving the needs of parents, teachers, and staff. As a senior visual designer, you will be responsible for designing for Web and Mobile, and establishing a design system from the ground up. You’ll also influence visual language, branding, marketing, and the end-to-end student, parent, and teacher experience at Sora beyond just digital touch-points.

Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are delightful and compelling.

We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the rest of the world.

Location and Salary

This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We’re excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don’t have experience in all the following areas.

We offer a competitive salary and perks based on the in country localized market.

Can you find simple design solutions to complex problems while also collaborating with multiple stakeholders?

If you have experience in redesigning websites to optimize user experience and can identify and troubleshoot UX problems, then we might have your next great job role.

Does any of this get you super excited? Are you ready for potentially the best professional experience of your career?

About the AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca is a global, science-led, patient-focused pharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of prescription medicines for some of the world’s most serious disease. But we’re more than one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies. At Astra Zeneca, we’re dedicated to being a Great Place to work!

The UX Designer/Researcher is responsible for using research to understand what users want/ need from digital products & services then using these insights to design products that are easy, safe, and delightful to use. These products and services will include both external (patient- and/or doctor-facing) and internal colleague-/scientist-facing tools, and cover a range of platforms (devices, websites, mobile apps, etc.).

We are looking for someone who can own and run a full, end-to-end UCD process. You should have strong UX Design skills and ideally have a good working knowledge of UX research methodologies and be able to carry out user research/usability testing yourself when necessary. Working by yourself or with a Researcher, you will use qualitative/ quantitative user research studies and/or analyse data from existing research. Ideally you will have experience with a range of user research methods including interviewing and observation.

You will use the outputs of the research to inform the early design process; for example, creating personas or user journey maps. Using the available insights, you will then design the product’s high-level UX (e.g. via flows and wireframes), plus lower-level interaction designs (e.g. via interactive prototypes) which unambiguously communicate the intended product experience. While visual design skills are a plus, our team’s focus is on maximum usability, not aesthetics.

You will iteratively improve your designs based on results from usability testing (carried out by yourself or others). You will work closely with technical developers during the build process to manage compromises and ensure the best possible UX is launched.

You will find ways to measure and prove the impact and value that your research and design interventions have made to the end user and/or the business. In order to make efficient use of our resources and ensure a consistent and learnable experience across products (when applicable), you will help to create design libraries where proven design patterns and interactions are documented for future reuse.

You will act as an advocate for users by ensuring that UX is kept top of mind throughout the design process. You will champion UX across the organization by helping senior Global stakeholders and project team members understand the value of UX, the User-Centered Design process and when/how to engage our team.

Requirements
• A thorough understanding of UX principles from on-the-job experience
• Experience (typically 3+ years) as a UX Designer – ideally working either in or for large, client-side companies. Experience working in a global distributed organization preferred
• Experience across UX Research methodologies – e.g. interviews, surveys, usability testing, field trials – and how they fit into a full UCD process. (Direct experience moderating such research is preferred).
• Experience using research insights to make design decisions, and in creating strategic design documents such as Personas, User Journey Maps and Storyboards.
• Experience creating high-level information architectures, low-level flows and wireframes, interaction designs, interactive prototypes, etc.
• Experience with using Figma or similar tools for UX design and interactive prototyping
• A portfolio of case studies where good UCD has made a difference to the quality of digital products and services
• Experience designing products for multiple platforms and user groups
• Working knowledge of Accessibility/ Inclusive Design principals and guidelines – i.e. ensuring the best experience for all users, independent of their (dis)ability
• Requirements (Soft Skills)
• A self-starter, not requiring hand-holding.
• An excellent listener, with the ability to quickly filter the relevant user insights for design
• An excellent presenter, succinctly imparting UX designs, with appropriate rationale, in both written and spoken formats, and in plain, non-technical language
• Great influencing skills, including the ability to evangelize UCD to stakeholders
• A great team player, able to work well as part of a small UX team and also collaborate closely with Product Managers, Business Analysts, Technical Developers, etc.
• Motivated to both give and receive constructive criticism on UX designs
• Able to successfully juggle the competing demands of multiple concurrent projects within a global corporate environment
• Must have excellent fluency in English- both verbal and written

Contract

Description
• You will be on the ground floor in designing a solution that health tech professionals will use daily to automate their workflows and help them get better at what they do. This is a new product with new design challenges (e.g., How do we build workflow automation and rules engine? How do we prioritize information displayed dynamically based on the workflow use case and various personas?). You’re not just building yet another e-commerce shopping cart here.?
• As a UX generalist, you’ll use the full spectrum of design skills: user research, information architecture, prototyping, ideation, interaction design, and visual design, to create compelling experiences for our customers.
• You will be responsible for effectively advocating for users and customers in a fast-paced environment with multiple business priorities. You’ll be the voice of the user throughout the software development process from conception to design to shipping in production.
• We’re an Agile company for the most part, but we know that means continuous improvement too. So you’ll be part of that evolution and you’ll drive user-centered design processes, working collaboratively with customers and cross-functional teams.
• We want to focus on outcomes not outputs, so you will measure effectiveness of the user and partner experience by defining research protocols, identifying relevant metrics, and conducting interviews.

Requirements
• 2-3 years or more working as a UX designer for SaaS / web / mobile applications in a professional capacity.
• A self-motivated, can-do attitude – You know a designer’s job does not end with mockups and specs. You should be comfortable within a highly iterative and collaborative design process. We move fast, we listen, and we adapt. We rapidly incorporate feedback, and we relentlessly collaborate. You must be adept at giving input and receiving critiques.
• Proven ability to design enterprise-level software with a great user flow and experience that is still visually compelling, with fluency in design tools like Figma, Sketch, InVision, etc.
• Experience designing with an iterative design process (such as Google’s Design Sprints), working on teams with an Agile mindset. You should be comfortable conducting user interviews, etc.
• Outcome-focused, process-oriented mindset, with a collaborative approach to interacting with other team members. Ability to prioritize, multi-task, and perform effectively under pressure
• Strong communication skills – listening, interpersonal, oral and written communication. Fluent in both spoken and written English?

Sora is the virtual private middle and high school turning today’s students into tomorrow’s change-makers. We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.

Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they’ve always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.

In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don’t spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don’t read many traditional textbooks — instead, they’re building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We’ve embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can’t wait for you to join us!

The Role

We are looking for a Senior User Interface Designer to drive the next stage of Sora's digital platform design.

The platform is critical in delivering an innovative educational experience to students as well as serving the needs of parents, teachers, and staff. As a senior visual designer, you will be responsible for designing for Web and Mobile, and establishing a design system from the ground up. You’ll also influence visual language, branding, marketing, and the end-to-end student, parent, and teacher experience at Sora beyond just digital touch-points.

Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are delightful and compelling.

We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the rest of the world.

Location and Salary

This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We’re excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don’t have experience in all the following areas.

• Design, contribute and maintain the Sora design system
• Communicate cross-functionally and advocate for the users at all organizational levels

We are a full-time school program accredited by Cognia, WASC, and approved by the NCAA.
Our mission is simple: build the replacement to the broken U.S. education system. No compromises, no reform. Most schools continue to do the same things they've always done: making students memorize content, test them, score them, and rank them. Unsurprisingly, students are losing their creativity and motivation, and are utterly unprepared to succeed in the real world.
In our virtual program, middle and high school students work on passion-based projects that they get to create and take wherever they wish. They don't spend their school hours attending lecture-based classes and don't read many traditional textbooks — instead, they're building video games, writing fantasy novels, conducting scientific research, and more! They connect with industry mentors to expose them to new careers and fields of study. Students learn not only the full breadth of academic subjects but also important soft skills and subjects such as financial literacy, philosophy, and more. Our school is organized in small, tight-knit cohorts so every group of students and faculty can feel close and engaged in their community. We've embarked on our journey to accelerate students toward their wildest dreams. We can't wait for you to join us!
The Role We are looking for a Senior User Interface Designer to drive the next stage of Sora's digital platform design.
The platform is critical in delivering an innovative educational experience to students as well as serving the needs of parents, teachers, and staff. As a senior visual designer, you will be responsible for designing for Web and Mobile, and establishing a design system from the ground up. You'll also influence visual language, branding, marketing, and the end-to-end student, parent, and teacher experience at Sora beyond just digital touch-points.
Sora is in-process of rebranding and redesigning all its digital touch points - this is the best time for a designer to join the team to innovate and design educational experiences that are delightful and compelling.
We are also scaling product design, service design, visual design, and the research team from the ground up. In this role, you will work closely with the Head of Design and Chief Product Officer and alongside some of the best minds in the industry to build something that no one has built before: a digital school that is the most loved high school in the U.S, and one day the rest of the world.
Location and Salary This is a fully remote position located anywhere in Mexico. We're excited to build a team with a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and encourage candidates to apply even if they don't have experience in all the following areas.

We have been growing as a business and now we are growing as a team, looking to add a Senior UX Designer that will focus on designing and delivering beautiful, useful and simple experiences for Photos on Devices.

Who you are:

You love the creative process. You’re a photos-obsessed, systems-thinking Senior UX Designer who craves to craft engaging, elegantly usable experiences and interactions. You’re hungry to apply your superior user experience and information architecture skills, visual design flair, problem-solving abilities, and soft skill expertise. You balance your passion for inspired, compelling, elegant, simple designs with a highly analytical nature, precise execution, and a relentless drive to design, build and deliver end-to-end experiences.

Key job responsibilities
• Use business requirements, usability findings and market research to develop scenarios, use cases, and high-level requirements
• Create user-centered designs by considering market analysis, customer feedback, site metrics, and usability findings

• Follow up on your live designs with testing and iteration
• Have fun! Design is a dream job and you should be doing your very best, most rewarding work

A day in the life

Ideally, you will be engaged in designing for the customer whenever possible.

If you are in meetings, they should be with people who can help you make decisions about your design. Otherwise, you are encouraged to decline.

Day-to-day, you will likely have ongoing in-person and virtual conversations happening with a group of designers, product managers, and engineers who might need your opinion or ideas, and vice versa.

About the team

We are all grown-ups, respected equally. We build our relationships with each other on thoughtful, honest feedback. If someone is struggling, help them by providing respectful, timely feedback.

Nobody will have the same depth of knowledge, experience and domain expertise you have for your current work. As the owner of the experience, you will have a leader who clears a path for you, and a team of peers to rely on for dialog and support.

The Design team meets weekly to share our work with one another, share good news, and laugh a little. Sometimes a lot.
