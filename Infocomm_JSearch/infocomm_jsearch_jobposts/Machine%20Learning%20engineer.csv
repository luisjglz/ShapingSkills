We are an early-stage, venture-backed fintech that focuses on bringing affordable credit and financial services to small business owners across LatAm - starting with Mexico.

Grupago is able to serve micro-SMBs as a result of three key innovations – AI-driven underwriting, group collateral, and community distribution:
• AI-driven underwriting: Grupago harnesses the power of AI including non-traditional data sources to underwrite small loans. Over time, they systematically expand credit limits as customers demonstrate successful repayment histories.
• Group collateral: Borrowers join together as part of lending groups and co-sign for each other’s loans. When a payment is missed, other members are responsible for repayment. This approach allows Grupago to profitably collateralize an otherwise uncollateralized customer segment, as well as build much more robust underwriting data than individual loans.
• Community distribution: Grupago acquires community leaders online, who then build lending groups in their local communities. This allows the company to reach rural and otherwise hard to reach customers via its unique and cost effective online-to-offline acquisition approach.

Grupago is the first fintech company in the world to bring together these components into a unique, fully digitalized offering. It is active in Mexico and seeks to scale across Latin America over time. Its first focus is on a group loan product focused on women entrepreneurs.

We are backed by top venture investors across the US and Mexico, and our co-founding team has spent their careers working in fintech and entrepreneurship.

This role will include a competitive salary, bonus, and equity compensation.

Responsibilities

We are looking for a hard-working and highly entrepreneurial data scientist / machine learning engineer to join our team and work with the co-founders to build and refine our initial machine learning model for automated credit issuance.

You will have primary ownership over managing our machine learning model to allow us to instantly approve new group loans at low loss rates.

You will have immense responsibilities and ownership across a small and highly capable team.

Your main responsibilities are to:
• Build our automated credit model
• Continuously improve and refine models focused on loss rates and profitability
• Work closely with the CEO and MX country manager to apply modeling and data science to other aspects of our business – especially acquisition and unit profitability

Experience

We are looking for a data scientist experienced in rapidly building machine learning models – ideally within credit underwriting.

Our ideal candidate has:
• A stellar track record across least 5 years of data science experience
• Ideally have work experience within micro-business credit or consumer households at the bottom of the pyramid
• Fluent in business English & Spanish
• Previous work experience at a startup or other fast moving, highly entrepreneurial work environment

We are an early-stage, venture-backed fintech that focuses on bringing affordable credit and financial services to small business owners across LatAm - starting with Mexico.

Grupago is able to serve micro-SMBs as a result of three key innovations – AI-driven underwriting, group collateral, and community distribution:
• AI-driven underwriting: Grupago harnesses the power of AI including non-traditional data sources to underwrite small loans. Over time, they systematically expand credit limits as customers demonstrate successful repayment histories.
• Group collateral: Borrowers join together as part of lending groups and co-sign for each other’s loans. When a payment is missed, other members are responsible for repayment. This approach allows Grupago to profitably collateralize an otherwise uncollateralized customer segment, as well as build much more robust underwriting data than individual loans.
• Community distribution: Grupago acquires community leaders online, who then build lending groups in their local communities. This allows the company to reach rural and otherwise hard to reach customers via its unique and cost effective online-to-offline acquisition approach.

Grupago is the first fintech company in the world to bring together these components into a unique, fully digitalized offering. It is active in Mexico and seeks to scale across Latin America over time. Its first focus is on a group loan product focused on women entrepreneurs.

We are backed by top venture investors across the US and Mexico, and our co-founding team has spent their careers working in fintech and entrepreneurship.
